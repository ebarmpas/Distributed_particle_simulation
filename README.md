# Distributed_particle_simulation

This project is a primordial particle system simulation as a distributed system.

This uses the Haddop framework and the MapReduce programming model.

This system will be made up by numerous particles, which interact with each other autonomously and independently.
This means that the particles have no communication with each other, and they interact with each other through a series of defined rules.

These basic rules are the same for every particle and are quite simple in nature.
However, despite the simple rules and independent actions taken, behaviors begin to emerge that makes it seem like the particles are communicating with each other.

This is what this whole project is about : Those emergent behaviors.
